    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  58,400    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    23 out of  37,680    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           67
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            33 out of      67   49%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      67    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          34 out of      67   50%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of 301,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
